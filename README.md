# Optical-Character-Recognition
Building out a Flask application having OCR capabilities to detect text from images using PyTesseract. 

PyTesseract is an optical character recognition package developed by Google to recognize and read the text embedded in images. We also build a Flask Application to make it more user friendly for the user to use the product. 

## Installation of required modules

pip install pytesseract
pip install pipenv
pip install Pillow
pip install Flask
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'

## Flask Application
